1;"We introduce the following combinatorial optimization problem: Given a connected graph G, find a spanning tree T of G with the smallest number of branch vertices (vertices of degree 3 or more in T). The problem is motivated by new technologies in the realm of optical networks. We investigate algorithmic and combinatorial aspects of the problem."
2;"Given a network represented by a graph  G=(V,E), we consider a dynamical process of influence diffusion in G that evolves as follows: Initially only the nodes of a given  S subseteq V are influenced; subsequently, at each round, the set of influenced nodes is augmented by all the nodes in the network that have a sufficiently large number of already influenced neighbors. The question is to determine a small subset of nodes S (a target set) that can influence the whole network. This is a widely studied problem that abstracts many phenomena in the social, economic, biological, and physical sciences. It is known that the above optimization problem is hard to approximate within a factor of  2^{log ^{1-epsilon }|V|}, for any  epsilon >0. In this paper, we present a fast and surprisingly simple algorithm that exhibits the following features: (1) when applied to trees, cycles, or complete graphs, it always produces an optimal solution (i.e, a minimum size target set); (2) when applied to arbitrary networks, it always produces a solution of cardinality which improves on previously known upper bounds; (3) when applied to real-life networks, it always produces solutions that substantially outperform the ones obtained by previously published algorithms (for which no proof of optimality or performance guarantee is known in any class of graphs)."
3;"This paper focuses on innovative solutions to the problem of transparency in Public Administrations (PAs) by opening up public data and services so that citizens participation is facilitated and encouraged. We introduce the motivating principles and the architectural solutions to a Social Platform for Open Data, that is designed in order to provide a sustainable and re-usable framework to provide collaborative and social access to Open Data provided by PAs. Our overall objective is to propose a engage citizens by making them able to socially interact over Open Data, by forming or joining existing online communities that share common interest and discuss common issues of relevance to local policy, service delivery, and regulation. The proposed architectural solution is supporting the citizens in a collective relationship among them (as a network helping each other) and with PAs so that the information provided by the Public Administrations is shared, interpreted, personalized, made easier to understand and discussed to assess its meanings. The results and benefits of our approach, as well as potential impact in the pilot experiences that are planned, are also discussed."
4;"The paper presents a recent development of an interdisciplinary research exploring innovative computational approaches to the scientific study of criminal behavior. The attention is focused on an attempt to combine social network analysis and agent-based modelling into CrimeMiner, an experimental framework that seamlessly integrates document-enhancement, visualization and network analysis techniques to support the study of criminal organizations. Our goal is both methodological and scientific. We are exploring how the synergy between ABM and SNA can support a deeper and more empirically grounded understanding of the complex dynamics taking place within criminal organizations between the individual/behavioral and social/structural level."
5;"A common approach to the formal description of pictorial and visual languages makes use of formal grammars and rewriting mechanisms. The present paper is concerned with the formalism of Symbol–Relation Grammars (SR grammars, for short). Each sentence in an SR language is composed of a set of symbol occurrences representing visual elementary objects, which are related through a set of binary relational items. The main feature of SR grammars is the uniform way they use context-free productions to rewrite symbol occurrences as well as relation items. The clearness and uniformity of the derivation process for SR grammars allow the extension of well-established techniques of syntactic and semantic analysis to the case of SR grammars. The paper provides an accurate analysis of the derivation mechanism and the expressive power of the SR formalism. This is necessary to fully exploit the capabilities of the model. The most meaningful features of SR grammars as well as their generative power are compared with those of well-known graph grammar families. In spite of their structural simplicity, variations of SR grammars have a generative power comparable with that of expressive classes of graph grammars, such as the edNCE and the N-edNCE classes."
6;"We compare the predictions of the dissipative quantum model of the brain with neurophysiological data collected from electroencephalograms resulting from high-density arrays fixed on the surfaces of primary sensory and limbic areas of trained rabbits and cats. Functional brain imaging in relation to behavior reveals the formation of coherent domains of synchronized neuronal oscillatory activity and phase transitions predicted by the dissipative model."
7;"We model the dynamical behavior of the neuropil, the densely interconnected neural tissue in the cortex, using neuropercolation approach. Neuropercolation generalizes phase transitions modeled by percolation theory of random graphs, motivated by properties of neurons and neural populations. The generalization includes (1) a noisy component in the percolation rule, (2) a novel depression function in addition to the usual arousal function, (3) non-local interactions among nodes arranged on a multi-dimensional lattice. This paper investigates the role of non-local (axonal) connections in generating and modulating phase transitions of collective activity in the neuropil. We derived a relationship between critical values of the noise level and non-locality parameter to control the onset of phase transitions. Finally, we propose a potential interpretation of ontogenetic development of the neuropil maintaining a dynamical state at the edge of criticality."
8;"Given a graph G = (V,E) and α ∈ R, we write wα(G)=∑xyϵEdG(x)αdG(y)α, and study the function wα(m) = max {wα(G): e(G) = m}. Answering a question from Bollobás and Erdös (Graphs of external weights, to appear), we determine wi(m) for every m, and we also give bounds for the case α ≠ 1."
9;"A remarkable family of free subsemigroups of a free semigroup, the family of weakly prefix subsemigroups, is considered. An algorithm for obtaining the minimal weakly prefix subsemigroup containing a given finite subset is proposed."
10;"The problem of constructing statistically synchronizable codes over arbitrary alphabets and for any finite source is considered. It is shown how to efficiently construct a statistically synchronizable code whose average codeword length is within the least likely codeword probability from that of the Huffman code for the same source. Moreover, a method is given for constructing codes having a synchronizing codeword. The method yields synchronous codes that exhibit high synchronizing capability and low redundancy."
11;"We define a family of Distributed Hash Table systems whose aim is to combine the routing efficiency of randomized networks—e.g. optimal average path length O(log 2 n/δlog δ) with δ degree—with the programmability and startup efficiency of a uniform overlay—that is, a deterministic system in which the overlay network is transitive and greedy routing is optimal. It is known that Ω(log n) is a lower bound on the average path length for uniform overlays with O(log n) degree (Xu et al., IEEE J. Sel. Areas Commun. 22(1), 151–163, 2004). Our work is inspired by neighbor-of-neighbor (NoN) routing, a recently introduced variation of greedy routing that allows us to achieve optimal average path length in randomized networks. The advantage of our proposal is that of allowing the NoN technique to be implemented without adding any overhead to the corresponding deterministic network. We propose a family of networks parameterized with a positive integer c which measures the amount of randomness that is used. By varying the value c, the system goes from the deterministic case (c=1) to an “almost uniform” system. Increasing c to relatively low values allows for routing with asymptotically optimal average path length while retaining most of the advantages of a uniform system, such as easy programmability and quick bootstrap of the nodes entering the system. We also provide a matching lower bound for the average path length of the routing schemes for any c."
12;"In this paper, we present the results of long-term research conducted in order to study the contribution made by software models based on the Unified Modeling Language (UML) to the comprehensibility of Java source-code deprived of comments. We have conducted 12 controlled experiments in different experimental contexts and on different sites with participants with different levels of expertise (i.e., Bachelor’s, Master’s, and PhD students and software practitioners from Italy and Spain). A total of 333 observations were obtained from these experiments. The UML models in our experiments were those produced in the analysis and design phases. The models produced in the analysis phase were created with the objective of abstracting the environment in which the software will work (i.e., the problem domain), while those produced in the design phase were created with the goal of abstracting implementation aspects of the software (i.e., the solution/application domain). Source-code comprehensibility was assessed with regard to correctness of understanding, time taken to accomplish the comprehension tasks, and efficiency as regards accomplishing those tasks. In order to study the global effect of UML models on source-code comprehensibility, we aggregated results from the individual experiments using a meta-analysis. We made every effort to account for the heterogeneity of our experiments when aggregating the results obtained from them. The overall results suggest that the use of UML models affects the comprehensibility of source-code, when it is deprived of comments. Indeed, models produced in the analysis phase might reduce source-code comprehensibility, while increasing the time taken to complete comprehension tasks. That is, browsing source code and this kind of models together negatively impacts on the time taken to complete comprehension tasks without having a positive effect on the comprehensibility of source code. One plausible justification for this is that the UML models produced in the analysis phase focus on the problem domain. That is, models produced in the analysis phase say nothing about source code and there should be no expectation that they would, in any way, be beneficial to comprehensibility. On the other hand, UML models produced in the design phase improve source-code comprehensibility. One possible justification for this result is that models produced in the design phase are more focused on implementation details. Therefore, although the participants had more material to read and browse, this additional effort was paid back in the form of an improved comprehension of source code."
13;"In recent years, the encounter between network analysis (NA) and Law has issued new challenges both on a scientific and application level. If, on the one hand, it is fostering new computational-inspired approaches to visualize, retrieve, manipulate and analyze legal information, on the other hand, it is inspiring the creation of innovative tools allowing legal scholars without technical skills to start dealing with NA and visual analytics on their own. This paper presents an ongoing research project aiming to explore how approaches and techniques at the boundaries between Network analysis, Legal informatics and Visualization can help shedding new light into legal matters. The attention is focused, on EuCaseNet, an online toolkit allowing legal scholars to apply NA and visual analytics techniques to the entire corpus of EU case law."
15;"Over the years, computation has become a fundamental part of the scientific practice in several research fields that goes far beyond the boundaries of natural sciences. Data mining, machine learning, simulations and other computational methods lie today at the hearth of the scientific endeavour in a growing number of social research areas from anthropology to economics. In this scenario, an increasingly important role is played by analytical platforms: integrated environments allowing researchers to experiment cutting-edge data-driven and computation-intensive analyses. The paper discusses the appearance of such tools in the emerging field of computational legal science. After a general introduction to the impact of computational methods on both natural and social sciences, we describe the concept and the features of an analytical platform exploring innovative cross-methodological approaches to the academic and investigative study of crime. Stemming from an ongoing project involving researchers from law, computer science and bioinformatics, the initiative is presented and discussed as an opportunity to raise a debate about the future of legal scholarship and, inside of it, about the challenges of computational legal science."
16;"The modelling of financial market movements and the predictions of price are deeply linked to the complexity, non linearity and the dynamism of the market itself. Many hidden factors contribute to these two subjects, which refer to the different kinds of operators (as fundamentalist and behaviourist), the different objectives amongst the retails, the institutional and business operators, the different time ranges and the different allocation plans. Moreover, the news effects on shortest time range, the induced sentiment and market movers play a key role in the modelling of the financial market. Two decision variables, named Energy E and Entropy S are introduced. Some specific values of these two variables act as attractors in the state space E-S; conesequently these two variables are useful for describing the price dynamics during the different market status (i.e. up trend, down trend, accumulation, and distribution). The result is a new decision framework, where the investor, the trader and the analyst may perform their prospects and forecasts. A multiparametric methodology for financial trading, investment and prospects analysis is defined and introduced, by following the Prospect Theory and by assuming the price fluctuations as a dynamical process in the stochastic context."
